# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This repository contains a simple yet engaging Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Two players can enjoy this game by taking turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Gameplay
- **Grid**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- **Players**: There are two players: one uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
- **Turns**: Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- **Winning Condition**: The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- **Draw Condition**: If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- **Interactive User Input**: Players input their move by entering row and column numbers.
- **Move Validation**: Checks for valid moves and prompts for re-entry if invalid.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects and announces a win or draw.
- **Replay Option**: After a game concludes, players can choose to play again.

## Instructions
1. **Starting the Game**: Run the `TicTacToeGame` class to start the game.
2. **Making a Move**: When prompted, each player enters the row and column where they wish to place their mark, separated by a space.
3. **Game Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a win or draw is reached.
4. **Replay**: After the game ends, type 'yes' to replay or any other input to exit.

## Requirements
- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed to run the game.
- Players must enter row and column coordinates as integers from 0 to 2.

## Running the Program
Compile and run the `TicTacToeGame` class to begin the game. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.
